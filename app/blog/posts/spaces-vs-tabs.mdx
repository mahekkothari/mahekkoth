Historically, the tech community has been exclusionary — with 
barriers related to networking opportunities, education prerequisites,
and access to information. Yet, the rampant growth and interest in 
crypto have slowly changed this narrative. It is no surprise that the 
younger and more technologically savvy generation is turning to X — formerly
known as Twitter, to reach a larger audience with their words and thoughts.
Since, all one needs is access to WiFi to simply learn from millions of
individuals from all sorts of backgrounds, ages, and experiences.

So, how has X revolutionized how we talk about crypto?

Due to involvement rising in the cryptocurrency market, let alone the tech 
community as a whole, the copious amount of news and updates cannot be only
managed by traditional news outlets. In traditional news outlets, the writers
are often slowed down by the process of drafting, outlining, and researching 
— while X allows users to quickly get their point across in 280 characters. 
Although this means these spaces are often followed by “informal” language, 
this allows the dialog to form and inclusive interactions between users to 
bloom.

This sentiment has been further articulated by Oliver Kraaijeveld and 
Johannes De Smedt, in their piece The predictive power of public Twitter 
sentiment for forecasting cryptocurrency prices:

<i> “Due to the relatively young age of the cryptocurrency market, traditional 
news outlets do not always timely report events, which has led to social media 
being a primary source of information for cryptocurrency investors. Specifically, 
the micro-blogging website Twitter is a widely used source for cryptocurrency 
information. Not only does Twitter provide live updates on cryptocurrencies, it 
is also a rich source of emotional intelligence, as investors frequently express
 their sentiment.” </i>

So as web3 development gives users more control over their data and digital identities, 
X gives its users control over the rapidly changing market conditions through 
real-time updates. These real-time updates have an impact on influencing financial 
markets, the study done by Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that X can provide a gauge
of how the market is doing by analyzing emotional tweeting outbursts. This is
because these emotional tweeting outbursts show how we are oftentimes debilitated 
by our emotional state, in turn influencing our decisions when it comes to stock 
market investments (Gilbert et. al 2010). Additionally, explosive emotional reactions 
influencing markets have also been further researched in the study by Li et al. (2017).
This study showed that social influence, such as increasing engagement to posts will 
amplify the relationship between a positive attitude on a certain financial asset with 
an abnormal financial return of gain or losses.

Moreover, social influence driving the ups and downs in the market is not something 
new to social media. Yet, it’s X’s ability to foster millions of conversations, 
individual thoughts and predictions, as well as quick updates that make its platform 
so unique. This collective that X has created through an accessible platform, has 
allowed public opinion to aid this exclusive space into one that is open on a world scale.
